## Abstract
Ensemble techniques are frequently encountered in machine learning and engineering problems since the method combines different models and produces
an optimal predictive solution. The ensemble concept can be adapted to deep
learning models to provide robustness and reliability. Due to the growth of the
models in deep learning, using ensemble pruning is highly important to deal with
computational complexity. Hence, this study proposes a mathematical model
which prunes the ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) consisting
of different depths and layers that maximizes accuracy and diversity simultaneously with a sparse second order conic optimization model. The proposed
model is tested on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and MNIST data sets which gives
promising results while reducing the complexity of models, significantly.
